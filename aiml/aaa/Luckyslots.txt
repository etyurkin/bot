Botmaster Steve Worswick, a.k.a Square Bear, creator of the popular
Mitsuku bot, has released a couple of cool free games in AIML, an
Anagram Game and a Slot Machine Game.

Slot machine style game Steve has also written a slot machine style
game in AIML with a "hold" feature. Make sure your bot doesn't comment
on repetition though, as it will probably complain after a few
spins. Type "luckyslots" to begin the game when you have loaded and
re-published your bot.
