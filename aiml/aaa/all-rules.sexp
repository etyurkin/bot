The " (get type8b) "s did not want another war. Some said the " (get type8b) "s were not even " (get type8) "s anymore, only " (get type5) "s. The " (get type4) "s too had grown weak and proud. The " (get type2a) "s went over to the side of the " (get type6a) "s. A new power, the " (get type8d) "s, appeared in the " (get home8d) ", and joined the \"axis\" along with the " (get type6a) "s and the " (get type2a) "s, threatening both the " (get type5) "s and the " (get type3) "s.   War began when the " (get type6a) "s demanded chunks of the old " (get type1a) " empire. The " (get type8d) "s attacked the " (get type3) "s and brought them into the war. Determined to eliminate all the " (get type8c) "s from the " (get environment) " of " (get world) ", the " (get type6a) "s " (get selfdefeat) ". Many of these " (get type8c) "s brought their great technical skills to the " (get home3) ", allowing the " (get type3) "s to develop the super-weapons necessary to win the war.   The Allies invaded " (get home4) " on June 6 and soon after brought the war in the " (get home6a) " to a conclusion. On August 5, the stronghold of the " (get type8d) "s in the " (get home8d) " was totally destroyed by the " (get type3) "'s new super weapon, and the war ended a few days later.   C. Cold " (get world) " War )  The development of Super Weapons soon spread to all the victors of " (get world) " War II, including the " (get type6b) "s. These seemed to make a new " (get world) " War impossible, for it would result in the total destruction of the " (get world) ". Instead, the two remaining superpowers, the " (get type3) "s and the " (get type6b) "s, divided " (get world) " up between them in a complex system of alliances.   A new power,  the " (get type6c) "s, emerged in the " (get home6c) ". At first, the " (get type6c) "s seemed firmly in the " (get type6b) "'s camp. But gradually as the stalemate of the " (get world) " Cold War continued, the " (get type3) "s were able to expand a small window on the " (get home6c) " into a large trade relationship that proved key to undermining the power structure of the " (get type6b) "s.   During the Cold " (get world) " War, the " (get type3) " brought together half " (get type1) "s, the " (get type2a) "s, the " (get type2c) "s, the " (get type4) "s, the " (get type5) "s, the western " (get type6a) "s, the " (get type7) "s, and the " (get type8c) "s. The " (get type6b) " had the remaining " (get type1) "s and eastern " (get type6a) "s, the " (get type6c) "s, the " (get type2b) "s and the " (get type2d) "s, " (get type8a) "s and many " (get type9) "s.  Rather that risk all-out " (get world) " War, the Superpowers often fought proxy wars, such as between the " (get type2) "s in " (get home2) " or the " (get type9) " " (get types) " in " (get home9) ", or in the civil wars among the " (get type2c) "s in " (get home2c) " and the " (get type2d) "s in " (get home2d) ".  Internal corruption and the inability to compete economically brought about the final collapse of the " (get type6b) " Empire on December 25. A last-minute failed coup attempt revealed the illegitimacy of the old regime, and paved the way for a new " (get type6b) " democracy.   D. New " (get world) " Order )  The end of the Cold " (get world) " War brought about many unexpected changes. The " (get type3) "s were the sole remaining superpower. But despite their democratic foundations, the " (get type3) "s began to pursue an independent imperialist course of action. This angered all the other " (get types) "s of " (get world) ". The " (get type3) "s could sometimes count on their old allies the " (get type5) "s, or sometimes the " (get type6b) "s, but they were often " (get goingalone) ".  Their only sure allies are the " (get type8c) "s, who now have their own homeland in the " (get home8c) ".  Now the very homeland of the " (get type3) "s, " (get home3) " is vulnerable to terrorists attacks from all over " (get world) ". The " (get type1) "s, the " (get type2) "s, the " (get type4) "s, the " (get type5) "s, the " (get type8) "s, the " (get type6a) "s, the " (get type6c) "s, " (get type9) "s, and all the other " (get types) "s now have grievances with the " (get type3) "s. The future seems to depend on how well the " (get type3) "s get along with the other " (get types) " of " (get world) "."))

("WHALE TALE" :template ((get whale) "s are so beloved that the authorities spent four months and $250,000  unsuccessfully trying to free a " (get right) " dubbed Churchill from fishing  ropes last year, and the stranding of 55 " (get pilot) "s near here a few weeks  ago prompted a lump in the national throat. The \"Save the " (get whale) "s\" ethos is  almost unquestioned, and " (get badboys) " and " (get badgirls) " risk becoming pariahs by  continuing to salivate when they see a nice juicy " (get whale) ".    But it's time to put sentiment aside. The \"save the " (get whale) "s\" campaign against  all commercial " (get whal) "ing was necessary a few decades ago, after " (get whal) "ing had  devastated all large species. Even today, there are fewer than 10,000 " (get blue) "s worldwide, compared with 200,000 before they were hunted, and " (get right) "s may become extinct.    But it is equally true that restrictions on " (get whal) "ing, including a moratorium  on all commercial " (get whal) "ing since 1986, have led to a sharp rebound in some  " (get whale) " stocks. The U.S. National " (get whale) " Service estimated in 2000  that there are more than two million " (get sperm) "s worldwide. The  International " (get whal) "ing Commission calculated years ago that there were more  than 900,000 " (get minke) "s and 780,000 " (get pilot) "s worldwide, and the  numbers are higher now. Milton " (get whale) "man, a " (get whal) "ing expert at the University of Alberta, estimates that the number of " (get minke) "s has trebled over 30  years and that " (get humpbacks) " are exploding at a rate of 12 to 17 percent  annually.    Indeed, the number of " (get gray) "s (which came off the endangered species  list in 1994) surged so much in the late 1990's that hundreds of dead ones  began washing up on West Coast beaches, so emaciated that their ribs showed.  The best guess is that the numbers of " (get gray) " grew, the food supply shrank and  Malthus had his way.    The bottom line is that while most large " (get whale) "s remain at risk, for some  species we can no longer argue that we need to \"save the " (get whale) "s.\" They've  been saved.    At a time when there's talk about over" (get whal) "ing, it's also worth pointing out  that " (get whale) "s now eat at least 300 million tons of marine life, three times as  much as humans. There is speculation that rising numbers of " (get minke) "s may  be holding down the population of " (get blue) "s that compete for similar food."))
