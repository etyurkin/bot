Botmaster Steve Worswick, a.k.a Square Bear, creator of the popular
Mitsuku bot, has released a couple of cool free games in AIML, an
Anagram Game and a Slot Machine Game.

An anagram game for AIML with scoring It gives the user a 9 letter
jumbled up word and the user has to guess the correct word. They get
one point for a correct answer. Say WORDPLAY to the bot to start the
game.

Square Bear says he chose 9 letter words for 2 reasons: 1) To make the
game reasonably difficult.  2) To stop duplicate answers. If he had
chosen four letter words for example, there could be many possible
answers. eg. Anagram is PTSO. The answer could be STOP, TOPS, SPOT etc

Square Bear says, "Feel free to use it in your own bots if you
wish. Naturally, you can add your own words. Be careful about
including words like 'favourite/favorite' , 'organize/organise' as
people from different countries will spell them in different
ways. Just add wordplay.aiml to your bot and re-publish to include my
game.
