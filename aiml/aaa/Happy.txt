Happy.aiml by "Square Bear" <steve@square-bear.co.uk>

If like me, you find it annoying when someone says "Happy Christmas" or
"Happy New Year" to your bot in the middle of July, or when they say Happy
Birthday to it when it's nowhere near its birthday you may like this AIML I
wrote. It will correct the user if they get the month wrong.

You will need to change the dates in the patterns of the birthday section to
your bot's birthday and feel free to change the responses too.

The AIML can be downloaded from :
