Multiple Choice Test

This simple Multiple choice test was created to fill a need
for multiple choice-friendly AIML "template" (not the AIML definition of
<template>, but in the generic sense) to 
"get right into quiz questions/diagnostic
tutoring". In this template the bot needs to lead with a math question
at the intro, allow for an incorrect answer and then make a correction 
and lead to another problem.   The teaching experts who use this "template"
must fill in the blanks/answers  --- they will make the bot's
language gentle, supportive, "PC", according to state standards
language, and often show jpegs/slides/be colorful.  

As a multi choice test, it's not quite right, as you only proceed to
the next question when the get the current one right!  But it serves
the purpose of training the student the correct answer along each step of
the way.

Taking the first question QUESTION I as an example, let us consider a few
of the ways the teacher might edit the category.  First, the question and
answer could be changed completely.  Or, the number of responses could be
increased (Yes/No or True/False) or Increased (A.-D., A.-E. etc.).  
You can also edit the responses to make the replies more helpful or "PC":

<category>
<pattern>QUESTION I</pattern>
<template>
Who is the best robot? <br/>
A. R2D2.<br/>
B. ALICE.<br/>
C. HAL 9000.<br/>

    It's okay to guess.  Think harder about what the question is asking you.<br />

    You are correct!  The robot ALICE is the "world's most human computer."  
    Now let us move on to the next question!<br />

    Not quite.  Remember, HAL 9000 is a fictional robot, not a real robot.  Try again!<br />

	Please answer the quiz questions with just A, B or C. Try again!<br />
